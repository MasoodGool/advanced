# Five Card Draw

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

What is Five Card Draw:

Five-card draw is a variant of poker where each player receives a hand of 5 cards, is then allowed to swap any number of those cards for new ones, and then competes against each other based on the standard 5 card poker hand strength. You need to design and develop a console based application which will deal and evaluate poker hands for a simplified version of the five-card draw variant. Like the five-card draw variant, the application will have to deal a hand of 5 cards, but unlike the five-card draw variant, no swapping will be allowed.

This application will:
* Simulate shuffling a standard deck of 52 cards
* Deal a single hand of 5 cards to the player.
* Evaluate the playerâ€™s hand, informing them of the highest ranked poker hand that matches their hand of 5 cards.

It is built using express JS so that it can be easily changed into a web API to easily interface with front end web application.
